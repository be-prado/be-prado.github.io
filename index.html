<h1> THE PORTFOLIO OF BERNARDO BIANCO PRADO </h1>

<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

<p>My name is Bernardo and I'm a second year graduate student at the University of Michigan in the Applied and Interdisciplinary
  Mathematics program. I'm originally from Curitiba, Brazil and I enjoy reading books and comics, playing tennis and playing music. I'm also
  interested in developing video games, writing stories and learning about music composition. When it comes to math, I'm researching 
  mathematical models of cancer and cancer treatment. I'm currently working on applying machine learning and statistical methods to
   learn a differential equation model of breast cancer from agent-based model data.

<h2>VIDEO GAME PROJECTS</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="list"><a href = "/projects/HungryCatCooking/index.html">HUNGRY CAT COOKING (BETA VERSION) </a><exp> Hungry Cat Cooking is a cooking paltforming 
      game where you will play as a cat that aspires to be the first feline to open a human restaurant! Of course, 
      a cat can't just open a restaurant and serve humans. There was a cat, however, who tried to accomplish such 
      feat beofre, albeit without success. To your luck, this old cat prepared a training that will prepare you 
      to succeed where he has failed. Check out the game trailer below!  </exp>
