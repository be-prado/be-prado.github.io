<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

<p>My name is Bernardo and I'm a third year graduate student at the University of Michigan pursuing a Masters degree in Electrical 
  and Computer Engineering and a Masters degree in Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics. I started at Michigan as an Applied 
  Mathematics PhD student and have since grown more interested in Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Game Development, and Computer 
  Graphics. I decided to use my PhD credits to get two Masters degrees and learn more about the subjects that interest me. You can scroll 
  down to see my Video Game Development and Computer Graphics projects. At the very bottom of the page I list two of my Mathematics 
  research projects. For my Machine Learning and Signal Processing projects, you can check out my GitHub linked right below this 
  paragraph. 
  <br> <br>
  I am passionate about all forms of story telling, I love video games, movies, books and music. I enjoy making and 
  listening to music and I am interested in how Machine Learning and Signal Processing can be used to make audio products better. I 
  play the guitar for fun and I am trying to learn how to play the bass and the harmonica. I think that's enough about me. Feel free 
  to connect with me on LinkedIn if you want to chat!

      Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend in C++, but it differs from the book's implementation in that the tracer was parallelized 
      using CUDA. The parallelized code achieved a performance improvement of 12 times compared to the original code! </exp>  </li>

      game where you will play as a cat that aspires to be the first feline to open a human restaurant! Of course, in the world we live in,
      a cat can't just randomly open a restaurant and serve humans. A long time ago, a fellow feline tried to accomplish such 
      feat and wasn't successful. To your luck, this old cat created a training that will prepare you 
      to thrive where he has failed. Check out the game trailer below!  </exp>
